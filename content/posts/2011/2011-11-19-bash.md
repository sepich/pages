#### Some bash hotkeys:
```
Ctrl + A  Go to the beginning of the line you are currently typing on
Ctrl + E  Go to the end of the line you are currently typing on
Ctrl + L  Clears the Screen, similar to the clear command
Ctrl + U  Clears the line before the cursor position. If you are at the end of the line, clears the entire line.
Ctrl + R  Letâ€™s you search through previously used commands
Ctrl + C  Kill whatever you are running
Ctrl + D  Exit the current shell
Ctrl + Z  Puts whatever you are running into a suspended background process. "fg" restores it.
Ctrl + W  Delete the word before the cursor
Ctrl + K  Clear the line after the cursor
Ctrl + T  Swap the last two characters before the cursor
Esc + T  Swap the last two words before the cursor
```
Some notes about reverse history search. It'll iterative show last command for your search query. For next item press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>R</kbd> again. To search forward press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>S</kbd>. (On some terminals this bind to freeze, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>Q</kbd> to defreeze)

#### Using screen:
1. Run `screen` to start session. Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>a</kbd> <kbd>d</kbd>, or disconnect ssh to detach.   
Run `screen -r` to reattach. I usually use `screen -x` - this will try to reattach, or create new session if no sessions exist.
1. Some hotkeys:
```
C-a c         Create a new window
C-a ?         Show key bindings
C-a 0 .. 9    Switch to window number 0 ... 9
C-a A         Allow the user to enter a name for the current window
C-a C         Clear the screen
C-a h         Write a hardcopy of the current window to the file "hardcopy.n".
C-a H         Begins/ends logging of the current window to the file "screenlog.n".
C-a k         Kill current window
C-a M         Toggles monitoring of the current win (will notify about changes in window)
C-a [space]   Switch to the next window
C-a [backsp]  Switch to the previous window
C-a [Esc]     Enter copy/scrollback mode
C-a d         Detach screen from this terminal
C-a D D       Detach and logout
C-a C-\       Kill all windows and terminate screen
```
1. Ok, lets imagine you watching log in screen's window. Needed part was clipped by top of window. When you scroll window content in tutty - you see old stuff lie here before running screen. To scroll screen's window content you need to go to copy mode by <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>a</kbd> <kbd>Esc</kbd> and there will be <kbd>PgUp</kbd> & <kbd>PgDn</kbd> keys available for scrolling.  
And more useful - <kbd>/</kbd> for forward search, and <kbd>?</kbd> - for reverse.
1. I often use tutty from mRemote, so titlebar is hidden. I need duplicate screen's window list on screen. This is my customized `screenrc` file:
    ```bash
    # Bind F11 and F12 (NOT F1 and F2) to previous and next screen window
    bindkey -k F1 prev
    bindkey -k F2 next
    
    # From Stephen Shirley
    # Don't block command output if the terminal stops responding
    # (like if the ssh connection times out for example).
    nonblock on
    
    startup_message off
    #nethack on
    caption always
    caption string "%-w %{= BW}%n %t%{-} %+w |%h"
    ```

#### Some commands:
`grep -v ^# /etc/sysctl.conf`  
Show file without commented lines (starting with #)

`find /etc -mmin -3`  
Files modified for last 3 minutes

`egrep -i 'err|warn' /var/log/messages`  
Last errors in log

`tail -f /var/log/messages`  
Watch for file changes and show them

`netstat -tulpn`  
Show opened ports

`find / -iname ip_queue.o`  
`which asterisk`  
Find file, find program dirs

`du -hs`  
Folder size

`tcpdump -i eth2 -nn 'tcp dst port 25'`  
Show outgoing smtp connections
